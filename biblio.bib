	abstract = {In recent years, we are witnessing a growing interest in large-scale situated systems, such as those falling under the umbrella of pervasive computing, Cyber-Physical Systems, and the Internet of Things. The actor model is a natural choice for designing and implementing such systems, thanks to the ability of actors to address distribution, autonomy of control, and asynchronous communication: namely, it is convenient to view the pervasive cyberspace as an environment densely inhabited by mobile situated actors. But how can an actor-centric development approach be fruitfully used to engineer a complex coordination strategy, where a myriad of devices/actors performs adaptive distributed sensing/processing/acting?
Aggregate computing has been proposed as an emerging paradigm that faces this general problem by adopting a global, system-level stance, allowing to specify and functionally compose collective behaviours by operating on diffused data structures, known as “computational fields”. In this paper, we develop on the idea of integrating the actor model and aggregate computing, presenting a software framework where declarative global-level system specifications are automatically turned into an underlying system of Scala/Akka actors carrying complex coordination tasks involving large sets of devices spread over the pervasive computing system.},

The suitability of this model is studied by considering a self-adaptive display infrastructure providing people nearby with several visualization services (advertisements, news, personal and social content). The key result of this article is that general-purpose chemical reactions inspired by population dynamics can be used in pervasive applications to enact spatial computing patterns of competition and gradient-based interaction.},

abstract="Swarm intelligent systems, in which the paths to problem solving emerge as the result of interactions between simple autonomous components (agents or ants) and between them and their environment, appear very promising to develop robust and flexible software application. However, the variety of swarm-based approaches that have been proposed so far still lacks a common modeling and engineering methodology. In the attempt to overcome this problem, this paper presents a general coordination methodology in which swarm's components are simply driven by abstract computational force fields (Co-Fields), generated either by agents, or by the environment. By having agents be driven in their activities by such fields, globally coordinated behaviors can naturally emerge. Although this model still does not offer a complete engineering methodology, it can provide a unifying abstraction for swarm intelligent systems and it can also be exploited to formalize these systems in terms of dynamical systems whose behavior can be described via differential equations. Several example of swarm systems modeled with Co-Fields are presented to support our thesis.",

We describe a framework where a network of shared tuple spaces handles services provided by situated agents, enabling their composition and competition in a fully distributed, self-organised way. This is achieved by a set of coordination laws structured as chemical-resembling reactions, designed so as to enact feedback loops that regulate and balance the “activity level” of (atomic or composite) services.},

abstract = "Abstract A number of recent works have investigated the notion of 
“computational fields” as a means of coordinating systems in distributed, dense 
and dynamic environments such as pervasive computing, sensor networks, and robot 
swarms. We introduce a minimal core calculus meant to capture the key 
ingredients of languages that make use of computational fields: functional 
composition of fields, functions over fields, evolution of fields over time, 
construction of fields of values from neighbours, and restriction of a field 
computation to a sub-region of the network. We formalise a notion of type 
soundness for the calculus that encompasses the concept of domain alignment, and 
present a sound static type inference system. This calculus and its type 
inference system can act as a core for actual implementation of coordination 
languages and models, as well as to pave the way towards formal analysis of 
properties concerning expressiveness, self-stabilisation, topology independence, 
and relationships with the continuous space–time semantics of spatial 
computations. "

Emerging programming models embrace this reality and provide abstractions inspired by physics, such as computational fields, that allow such systems to be programmed holistically, rather than in terms of individual devices. This paper aims to provide a unified approach for the investigation and engineering of computations programmed with the aid of space{\textendash}time abstractions, by bringing together a number of recent results, as well as to identify critical open problems.},

  abstract = "The complexity of pervasive computing systems is rapidly increasing, and this calls for service models and coordination approaches intrinsically manifesting self-organisation of component interactions. The goal of this paper is to provide a coordination model (formalised as a process algebra) capturing the relevant aspects of such systems. It should allow the behaviour of large-scale, situated, and self-organising systems to be conveniently expressed, paving the way towards their rigorous study as well as development of supporting platforms. Focusing on the recently introduced concept of pervasive ecosystems, the proposed model revolves around (i) the notion of a distributed and dynamic space of “live semantic annotations” (wrapping data, knowledge, and the relevant facts about activities of humans, devices, and services) upon which autonomous agents coordinate and (ii) a small set of chemical-resembling coordination rules that enforce mechanisms of diffusion, aggregation, decay, and bonding between such annotations.
